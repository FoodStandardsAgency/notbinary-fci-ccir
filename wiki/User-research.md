# Research Approach 

User research is conducted to understand

- How key roles interact with the service
- What their goals with the service are
- Context and cultural attributes
- Tools and technical requirements
- Pain points and frustrations
- Opportunities to improve the service

Outputs include [personas](#about-personas) and user journey maps.

## Identifying users 

### Identifying Audience Segments
In the 1st week of discovery, the project team met to identify and hypothesise all the different user groups potentially connected to FCI - CCIR. 
Primary, secondary and stakeholder audiences were identified and [User Segments](user-segments) prioritised for user research. 
In the first half of this session we considered the following to identify user groups:
* What types of contexts they work in (relevant variability)?
* What the national picture is / location of the work?
* What variances occur by species?
* What variances in relationships between user groups exist (e.g. Producer-FBO size and commercials)?

### Identifying Research Interview Targets
In the second half of the session we continued to prioritise user groups for research based on 
* What they can tell us about (reasonable insights to issues of interest)?
* What is their proximity to FCI-CCIR data tasks (creating / handling / consuming)?
* What is their likely availability?
* Who can inform us (act as proxies) for other important but hard to reach audiences?
* Who wears more than one hat / can inform us in multiple topics?
* Who is a first hand witness vs. removed from daily reality?

## Research Methods
The primary research for this discovery occurred during the early days of April 2020 Covid Lockdown. This provided some opportunities and challenges for reaching target user groups.

Our primary method was:
- [ ] Remote 1 to 1 interviews over Google Meet 
- [ ] Ranging from 1hr-1.5hr long

We were unable to conduct:
- [ ] Contextual Observation (shadowing)
- [ ] Sufficient direct interviews with external users (Farmers or FBO's)

We found it difficult to recruit external user groups who were busily engaged with the Covid-19 effort or affected by self isolating staff shortages e.g. farmer & FBO representatives. Due to the smaller number of interviews conducted with these groups, and the fact they were with proxies, we would therefore advise that evidence to validate the OV & MHI personas and user needs is greater than that for the Farmer and FBO personas, who may benefit from additional targeted research in any future phases of this work.
 
### Research Schedule

- [ ] Week 3: Official Veterinarians (E&J furloughed) - 3 OV's, 1 Area Veterinary manager
- [ ] Week 4: Meat Hygiene Inspectors (FSA self isolating) - 3 experienced, 1 trainee (range across species)
- [ ] Week 5*: Farming & FBO industry representatives (NFU, AHDB, BMPA, AIMS) - target 2 interviews per user segment.

Due to delays in recruitment in week 5* these interviews mostly took place in week 6.

### Research Scripts
Discussion guides were developed, tailored for interviews with each audience type;

## About Personas

Personas are behavioural archetypes that illustrate fictional individuals from key user segments. They are evidence driven, combining insights from across all research participants within a segment and are not a representation of any one individual.

Design personas capture:
* Personal profile, role, attitudes and behaviours.
* Tools, skills and context of use.
* Tasks, motivations and goals.
* Key pain points and barriers with the task, tool or service

Personas are intended as a design tool and reference point, to support and inform a user centric approach to solving key service challenges. By keeping the attributes of different audience groups visible and front of mind, the design and service team can ensure they remain focussed on end user realities and goals. 

They inform and support reflective critique of work-in-progress (designs or builds).

They should evolve as the project progresses and more is learned about each one and further sub-personas may emerge.
