[![Sprint 7 Retrospective board](uploads/retro/retro-7.png)](uploads/retro/retro-7.png)

## Kudos

- Stephen for "powerful walkthrough" of service blueprint
- Jonno for taking on Miro and turning out the IRIS interaction flow.
- Richard Withers, Jane Clark, Paul Turner, Jag Mark and Shaun for joining the service blueprint. Different mix of participants this time but it worked well for the subject matter.
- Jag for the great ability to convert our synthesis into a strong nutshell on the hoof at the end of a long session
- Solid work on the IRIS flow

## Went well


- Jonno: Crack-on time has been good!
- Miro - not that bad surprisingly!
- Heads down time - clear runs at analysis before trying to come up with conclusions is valuable thing to protect time for
- User flow work through went well
- Synth session
- Miro has been a good tool for 100% remote working (synth boards etc).
- Service blueprint was different again but useful insights and feedback.
- Monkey magic
- Seeing the crossover and everything coming together well with the deliverables.
- Synthesis part 2 - long session but really good conclusions and clear cohesions between us on the themes.
- Synth session was useful way to keep things on track and align the workstreams again.
- Reasonably clear days to focus, especially to concentrate on the blueprint this week!


## To improve

- Slow to compile user needs, bit wood for trees at times, lots of missing context feels wrong, and shoehorning lots of 'so that' context and pain points in absence of a task flow. Lesson for sticking to traditional journeys.
- Felt like an extra compressed week with a bank holiday and catching up after the additional time used for stakeholder research last week.
- Synth session overran by an hour and a half!
- Remote working birthdays. üç∞
- Working flat out to finish next week  ü§î
- Feeling the pressure of no friday next week to tie off wiki
- Plasterboard procurement
