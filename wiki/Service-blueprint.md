## Understand the service blueprint

Business analysts and service designers take all the things that are needed to make a service work (such as people, processes, technology) and put them in context. The service blueprint is a way of collating and summarising that information in a single page.

This blueprint gives an end-to-end view of everything that should be considered to make the **FSA's legislative requirement to deliver Food Chain Information and the Collection & Communication of Inspection Results** work as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The blueprint shows the touch points between activities that make up the service and the various components that enable those activities to happen. Touch points should be seen as triggers to be considered by anyone involved in designing, operating or changing the service.

The blueprint addresses a service-level view; the user-level experience is addressed elsewhere in [user segments](user-needs#user-segments), [personas](personas), and [user stories](user-stories).

## Service lifecycle, stages, and 'jobs to be done'

Each row in the blueprint represents a stage or activity in the service lifecycle. Each stage is broken down to show the **'jobs to be done'**, the activities that make up how **Food Chain Information** and **Collection & Communication of Inspection Results** are delivered as part of a much longer sequence of activities **'from the farm to the fork'**.

This gives us a sense of the tasks involved in delivering an end-to-end service, and shows that FCI and CCIR are not standalone pieces of work. This view also provides an indicator of where we would need to track and trace information and data through the food production process.

Based on research and analysis in [<discovery timeframe>](timeline-and-ceremonies), the blueprint has been designed around the following stages in the traceability journey:

- On the farm
- In transit
- At the market/collection centre
- At the slaughterhouse (On arrival)
- At the slaughterhouse (Ante-mortem)
- At the slaughterhouse (Post-mortem)
- Reporting

**Note.** Subsequent stages are are included in the blueprint to provide a more complete map of how the data that enables animal health & welfare and food safety fits into a continuous traceability journey, but are not covered in depth as they do not specifically relate to FCI and CCIR. 

Activities that relate to operating the service are also included as 'jobs to be done'. These tend to run in parallel to the main service delivery. They are often the things that 'just happen' and which can be easy to dismiss as being separate from FCI and CCIR.

## Enabling components
Each column in the blueprint shows an enabling component, such as the user/stakeholder, governance, and the information and/or technology being used. It also shows any metrics and the constraints that should be taken into account when designing and operating the service.

This means we can cross-reference factors across the lifecycle of the service and keep the bigger picture in mind. It means we can identify priorities and ensure the right people are involved in the right way and at the right time.

The service blueprint allows us to focus on improving each job to be done with an awareness of all the corresponding touchpoints; or we can focus on a particular component such as a piece of technology and review which jobs to be done it impacts. We can minimise the risk of fixing things in isolation.

### Points to call out
* Having a record of the geographic location history of livestock, as captured through a farm registration for example, is a critical element of traceability, movement tracing, and risk profiling. Location history also assists in identifying livestock from areas or premises that may have restrictions placed on them and which require special handling as a result.

* Segmentation of the industry plays a key role in determining the how inspections are delivered and what information is required.

* All livestock with the exception of poultry require a movement licence.

* Transportation of livestock introduces additional welfare risks, and increases the value of robust animal identification schemes. The haulier becomes the keeper for the duration of transportation, adding to the chain of keepers.

* Information retention periods are poorly-defined. As a minimum, data should kept for the lifespan of the product but practice is more likely to be driven by the traceability demands of consumers and retailers and other assurance schemes.

* The regulations only require 'one up/one down' data transfer. There are species-specific regulations that expand on this legal minimum, particularly with cattle where beef labelling at the retail stage dictates a more robust continuation of data from farm to fork. Similarly export certification may be a stipulation of a trade agreement between the UK and third country.
 In theory this should create and maintain a complete chain of information as data passes between users and stakeholders. In practice it is difficult to have confidence this happens. The diverse ways of working, methods of data collection and management, numerous data transfers, and complex mix of objectives and outcomes means that break points are created in the chain.

* Markets should not be seen as the final point before livestock is sent for slaughter. Although this may be the case, animals can also pass to other farms; they may be sent for finishing; they may be transported and passed to a different haulier. Markets therefore present additional complexity in the process.

* Animal identification which may be robust up to arrival at the slaughterhouse can be undermined by FBO practices. Cattle for example must have unique identification (ear tags). However tags are often replaced with a manually applied kill number in the plant.

* FCI is often received on trust. In practice an FBO is more likely to leave rejection of animals for slaughter to the FSA as the competent authority and regulator rather than reject animals on arrival. This however generates additional tasks and/or rework when FSA inspectors undertake rectification work to minimise meat being thrown away.

* The need to take FCI on trust, rather than it being an easily auditable piece of data, makes managing fraud in the livestock supply sector more difficult to manage.

* Tracing issues to the holding of origin typically results in the FSA passing cases to the relevant local authority as the responsible authority for farms. This creates a break point in the traceability journey and means eventual outcomes can become obscured and the food production/traceability loop cannot be closed. There is very little way to track how many issues raised by the FSA in this way are pursued to resolution, making it hard to measure success.

* The complex mix of competent authorities over different areas and for different issues makes it difficult to support the burden of proof, for example where the FSA, local authority, and the National Food Crime Unit need to operate in the same space.

* Matching data to animals is extremely complex at the ante- and post-mortem stages. There is a need for visual cues on the slaughter line; purely digital methods are not practical in the working environment but this creates a need to connect manual and digital recording.

* The connection between 'how we do things' and 'why we do things' is not always clear; there is a consensus that removing unfit meat from the food chain is the goal but solutions need to address how the Official Controls are seen to add value.
