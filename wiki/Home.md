This wiki documents research and [recommendations](recommendations) for [managing FCI and CCIR data](definition). 

Findings are based on a [discovery](methodology) project carried out by [Notbinary](team) during [March - May 2020](timeline-and-ceremonies). 

The discovery [goal](scope) is to review the way data is captured and recorded for 
- Food Chain Information ([FCI](glossary#fci)) 
- Collection and Communication of Inspection Results ([CCIR](glossary#ccir))

The aim is to understand opportunities to improve compliance with regulatory requirements, particularly for the accessibility and communication of sufficient, reliable and useful data within the food supply chain. 

This will support the definition and description of a minimum viable product (internal) and partnership opportunities (external) to improve compliance.
