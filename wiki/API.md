# FSA owned FCI and CCIR API
Based on the research we’ve done we believe that an end-to-end API would be a worthwhile investment for the FSA to build. We know there are existing APIs including the link in from Hellenic to IRIS and the integration to the Pig Hub (BPEX). However, there are a lot of opportunities to address areas that are not being covered with the current methods of working.

We know that CCIR feedback is not always getting back to farmers and producers. The FSA passes this back to FBOs who in turn can choose to pass information on to the farmers - we know this isn’t generally happening. We’ve heard this directly from multiple OVs.

We know that data has many hand-offs before it is entered into IRIS
For example:
1. From the MHI on the line’s memory after the fact to a white board
2. From the whiteboard to a laminated sheet on a clipboard by the FBO
3. From the sheet into an FBO system
4. From the system, printed out as a spreadsheet and returned to the OV
5. Returned to the OV and entered into IRIS.

This is just one way we heard about. An API with a direct feed from the line to IRIS would remove some of these steps (much like the hellenic system does already) and therefore could improve the data integrity

We know that there are various options for farmers in the form of apps and digital technologies that already include ARAMS and therefore the FCI information. However, we know that this information does not feed into IRIS or any other FSA system, therefore users are required to duplicate effort in order to complete the FCI.

By establishing strong working relationships with vendors and and providing a fully documented API that explains how to integrate to it the FSA would not have to do any of the app development and could make use of tools and systems already in use - such as AgriWebb. This could close the feedback loop and improve the integrity of both FCI and CCIR data.

The key thing here is going to be **interoperability** - ensuring this tool works with external parties, as well as internal departments and tools and initiatives such as LIP. This will make an API scaleable,
