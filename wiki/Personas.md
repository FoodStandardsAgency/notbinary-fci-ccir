[![FCI and CCIR Personas](uploads/personas-fci-ccir-2.jpg)](uploads/personas-fci-ccir-2.jpg)
*[Download as PDF](uploads/personas-fci-ccir-3.pdf)*

Data collected through in-depth user interviews was used to compile representative [user personas](user-research#about-personas).  These capture essential information about these users, their roles, needs, goals, and specific pain points with FCI and CCIR service.

- OV & MHI Personas are informed by 8 ( x4 each) 1:1 interviews directly with those user groups.

- Farmer, FBO and larger producer Personas were informed by feedback from representative bodies (proxies) and smaller samples. Some of these interviews were in small interview groups of 3 as opposed to 1:1. We also used OV & MHI perspectives and desk research to further inform and round out our picture of these harder to reach user groups.


_Internal FSA Personas_
* Official Veterinarian - [Ivan](#ivan---official-veterinarian-ov) 
* Meat Hygiene Inspector - [Clare](#clare---meat-hygiene-inspector-mhi)

_External to FSA Personas_
* FBO Abattoir Manager - [Neil](#neil---abattoir-manager-fbo)
* Farmer (Cattle & Sheep) - [Jeff](#jeff---farmer-cattle--sheep)
* Ops Manager Poultry Producer-Processor - [Saskia](#saskia---ops-manager-large-poultry-plant)

Roles, context goals and pain points for primary user segments are outlined below.

## Ivan - Official Veterinarian (OV)
   `"Food safety, welfare, disease - it all stops with me."`
### Role & Responsibility
- [ ] Receiving and checking FCI from Farmer (via FBO).
- [ ] Conducting & recording Ante Mortem (AM) inspections in the lairage
- [ ] Official release of animals for slaughter
- [ ] Record AM and PM inspection results into the IRIS system (end of shift)
### Context & Technology
- [ ] 80% of time in the lairage, visit the MHI line 2-3 times a shift. Time poor for office work.
- [ ] Usually have a mobile on me, regularly called away.
- [ ] Way of working heavily paper driven (FCI printed, ante-mortem inspection forms, clipboards, pen cards). 
- [ ] Don't use Hellenic or similar FBO systems.
### Primary Goals
- [ ] Identify and enforce animal welfare issues at both producer site and FBO premises.
- [ ] Ensure animals for slaughter are traceable and safe to enter the food chain.
- [ ] Flag possible disease before slaughter for further post-mortem inspection.
### Pain Points
- [ ] Communicating with the MHIs on the line (must first change overalls and get clean).
- [ ] IRIS data entry - painfully slow by producer batch, precious little time for for data entry.
- [ ] FBO hostility at times, objecting to my decisions and I have to be authoritative.

## Clare - Meat Hygiene Inspector (MHI)
   `"My job is physical and fast paced. I have to be focussed"`
### Role & Responsibility
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem inspections.
- [ ] Record tallies of disease or rejection reasons per producer batch or shift.
- [ ] Report condition / rejection volumes to the OV & FBO.
- [ ] Maintain ID of an animal along the line to point of grading & weighing.
### Context & Technology
- [ ] Work in MHI pair shifts of 30-45 minutes on a production line before rotating/ break.
- [ ] Often noisy, damp and confined spaces.
- [ ] Hands occupied, gloved with chainmail, ear protection, hard hats, wellies, knife holster
- [ ] Recording variably on metal clicker banks, tally boards or sheets or digital terminals.
### Primary Goals
- [ ] Spot diseased or contaminated meat and remove it from the food chain (food safety).
- [ ] As much as possible, work quickly to avoid holding up the line with inspection tasks.
- [ ] Keep tabs on which carcasses and offal / other trims go together (traceability).
### Pain Points
- [ ] Speed & mental load to remember to record every rejection reason accurately.
- [ ] Variable inspection point ergonomics make it harder to record accurately, consistently.
- [ ] Having to convert FBO PM data reports to align with IRIS input fields.
- [ ] Suspect tampering/errors in FBO post-mortem inspection data.

## Neil - Abattoir Manager (FBO)
   `"We're here to run our business, not the FSA's business."`
### Role & Responsibility
- [ ] Maintain efficient slaughter operations (line speed, staffing, hygiene, admin, etc.)
- [ ] Verify receipt of FCI & identity docs and provide FCI and kill plans to the OV
- [ ] Health & welfare of live animals at plant
- [ ] Maintain animal, carcase and meat traceability (1 step forwards and back).
### Context & Technology
- [ ] Large office admin overheads, lots of paperwork, email, fax from & to producers.
- [ ] Proliferation of systems recording different operational data (atmospheric, grade etc.)
- [ ] Slowly upgrading and integrating more technology and data as we can afford it.
- [ ] Same day price and grade data for farmers.
### Primary Goals
- [ ] Balance legal responsibilities with commercial drivers.
- [ ] Maximise ‘uptime’ of the kill line (throughput speed vs. product damage + staff costs).
- [ ] Optimise or pivot kill plans to manage supply (farmers) and demand (retailer).
### Pain Points
- [ ] Having to wait anything from a day to a week to get the FSA IRIS report back.
- [ ] Data in FSA report isn't attributable to a producer (recorded by day totals) so I can't use it to charge the right farmer for rejections.
- [ ] Paying for expensive FSA staff to do manual data entry.

## Jeff - Farmer (Cattle & Sheep)
   `"Farming is not a desk job. I need more feedback, not red tape."`
### Role & Responsibility
- [ ] Responsible for welfare and health of animal at farm and in transit.
- [ ] Complete & supply accurate / timely FCI
- [ ] Adhere to movement and food chain laws
- [ ] Provide animal identity documentation
- [ ] Observe drug treatment withdrawal limits.
- [ ] Declare disease or movement restrictions.
### Context & Technology
- [ ] Physical outdoor job, away from office PC, no printer, smartphone increasingly used.
- [ ] Familiar with DEFRA movement forms (but never seen a MOC / MIG).
- [ ] Self professed luddite but growing interest in apps and online tools to manage farm admin and reduce paperwork.
### Primary Goals
- [ ] Turn a profit (carcase weight & grade) amid a competitive market.
- [ ] Fulfil my legal obligations when selling for slaughter (avoid fines or detained carcases).
- [ ] Monitor my herds' health (assess my rearing practices on productivity).
### Pain Points
- [ ] Non-standard forms - the financial consequences of me missing or ticking the wrong FCI box can be huge.
- [ ] It's a rare bonus if I get a 'health report' back. Even rarer for it to be useful. I get nothing from markets at all.
- [ ] Distrustful of FBOs trying to pass on bogus charges and costs that are not my doing.


## Saskia - Ops Manager (Large Poultry Plant)
   `"I need better quality data, quicker and more of it."`
### Role & Responsibility
- [ ] Centrally gather data from agri-managers at rearing sheds daily (including health & FCI)
- [ ] Devise optimal weekly kill plans (managing bird age, condition, drug withdrawal periods).
- [ ] Monitor slaughter data in near real time, feedback to producer and react quickly to pivot production plan.
### Context & Technology
- [ ] Highly data driven, office based, expert spreadsheet literacy.
- [ ] Access to own full lifecycle of data, (from hatchery to slaughter).
- [ ] Produce large printed FCI and kill plan packs for FSA (mismatched maturity)
- [ ] Provide and maintain Hellenic digital terminals for MHIs to enter post-mortem condition data.
### Primary Goals
- [ ] Maintain tight traceability - reduce potential scale and cost of product recalls.
- [ ] Monitoring large data sets for the smallest of productivity gains (rearing and health).
- [ ] Meet/exceed quality and welfare agreements for assurance schemes and retail clients.
### Pain Points
- [ ] FSA's digital immaturity, holding us back from fully digitising our methods and tools.
- [ ] Slow turnaround of data, we have to collect our own in parallel to remain reactive to supply quality or welfare issues.
- [ ] Condition ID and/or recording inconsistencies between FSA teams - training issue.
