## Overview of service volume and metrics
There is very little visibility of Food Chain Information due to the way information is largely collected based on FBO ways of working with producers. It may be re-captured by Official Vets as part of the checks on livestock at the point of arrival at the slaughterhouse and as part of the ante-mortem preparations but by this point the original FCI as provided by producers could be degraded, particularly if the animals have passed through several keepers and especially where they have passed through a livestock market.

The FSA has published the FCI it requires and this should be incorporated into any FBO- or third party-produced forms and systems. There is no apparent tracking that this is the case however, so compiling metrics around FCI compliance is difficult and hampered by fragmented approaches to collecting and handling it. 

The consequences of losing sight of FCI include the inability to facilitate complete true traceability due to:
* a record of the chain of keepers not being fully retained.
* the geographic location history of livestock not being fully retained.
* the original animal identification not being consistently retained.
* the associated transportation history of livestock not necessarily being retained in conjunction with FCI.
* increased challenges associating inspection result data with the corresponding FCI and holding of provenance.

The most readily available data is inspection results captured in IRIS. Again, the FSA has its own minimum, species-specific requirements for post-mortem inspection data capture. Our research suggests this can be below or differrent the level of detail required by FBOs to meet their own traceability needs which are typically driven from either their producer suppliers, or their retail customers, or both. This mismatch in data capture needs results in double-handling and rework. The FSA typically receives final inspection results data second hand, having provided results to the FBO to review and process and then receiving a version back.

CCIR data does provide a detailed picture of the workload and amount of information that should, or could, be provided to primary producers and other stakeholders in the food production and animal welfare space.

## Volumes
The following tables provide a snapshot of the farm to slaughterhouse journey in key statistics:

### Scale of operations

The table below gives an indication of the scope of the service. This suggests that the FSA shares responsibility for the delivery of FCI and CCIR data with 280 Food Business Operators approved as slaughterhouses/abattoirs (according to approval numbers captured via FCI and logged in IRIS).

| Statistic                                                               | Data   | Notes                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| Number of primary producers                                             | 27,054 | April 2019 to March 2020 (IRIS) |
| Number of livestock markets / collection centres                        |   302  | April 2019 to March 2020 (IRIS) |
| Number of Food Business Operators approved as slaughterhouse / abattoir |   280  | April 2019 to March 2020 (IRIS) |


### Resourcing
There are approximately 900 inspection staff comprising Official Veterinarians (OV), Meat Hygiene Inspectors (MHI) and Contract Meat Hygiene Inspectors (CMHI).

All official veterinary inspection staff are procured via the Service Delivery Partner (Eville & Jones). Meat Hygiene Inspectors are either employed by the FSA or procured via the Service Delivery Partner. The table below shows contract staff break down and utilisation (as at October 2019), and were provided by Eville & Jones.

Team        | Metric           | Finding  |

| Official Veterinarians | No. of AVM | 14 (all qualified OVs)
|  | No. of OV | 288
|  | No. of OV required as FTE at 100% utilisation | 255
|  | Utilisation | 88%
| Meat Hygiene Inspectors | No. of ARM | 14 (9 OVs, 5 MHI)
|  | No. of VMHI | 80
|  | No. of MHI | 209 (non-vet)
|  | No. of MHI required as FTE at 100% utilisation | 274

### Number of broiler reports
The Broiler Directive requires specific reporting on poultry to be collected and distributed. This is the only inspection data where the FSA has a direct role in communicating it to the relevant stakeholder; in this case, the data is passed back to FSA Operations Assurance (Contracts & SLA Team) who forward it as a report to APHA.

| Year | Month    | No. of reports |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 2020 | January  |       376      |
|      | February |       331      |
|      | March    |       390      |
|      | April    |       252      |
