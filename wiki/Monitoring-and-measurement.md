## Continuous improvement as a way of working

Continuous improvement is a critical part of ensuring a service remains fit for purpose and making it a long-term success. Continuous improvement means having an ongoing approach to monitoring and measuring all the elements that make up a service and refining them as situations and business needs change.

## Current situation
### Compliance
Although there are legislated requirements to collate and manage FCI and CCIR, there are **no apparent key performance indicators in place to determine whether those obligations are being met and to what extent**. Indeed, **the lack of monitoring and measurement around FCI and CCIR is a key finding of this discovery**. 

It is simply not possible to find readily-available information that demonstrates how far and how well the FSA is meeting the obligation to provide primary producers with inspection data. Nor is it easy to confirm what FCI is being provided to FBOs and how timely it is. This is not to say information is not being collected and/or communicated. It is a known known that this is occurring; the known unknown is the timeliness, consistency, quality, and usefulness of the data and how far it supports initiatives in animal health & welfare and food safety. It is also known that where reportable disease or major issues are detected in the course of inspections, these are being acted upon following official guidance.

The Broiler Report, where data is passed from FBOs to the Contracts & SLA Team for processing and forwarding to APHA, is the only part of inspection results communication that can be tracked and measured to any extent. There is no such similar reporting, where data is passed back through the FSA for onward communication, for other species.

It is worth noting that from a legislative perspective, the regulations do not stipulate timeframes for communicating inspection results. Our user research provided anecdotal evidence that timeframes vary from plant to plant and can range from short turnaround periods of a day to up to two weeks where other issues, such as staff leave or operational demands reduce the capacity to manage the data any sooner. 

We are aware that FBOs have the capacity to invoice and/or pay primary producers for completed slaughter work within relatively short timeframes and that finance data processing can happen quickly.

The key point is that there is a benefit to producers, animal health & welfare, and food safety overall the sooner inspection data findings can be acted upon. This is an area where the FSA could develop value-add and enhance its reputation among its core audience.

There are number of potential causes for the lack of monitoring and measurement:
* As the [Service Context](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fci-ccir/wiki/service-context) and [Timeline](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fci-ccir/wiki/service-timeline) sections show, FCI and CCIR are caught between two parallel but distinct tracks of work. For operations, FCI and CCIR enable food production processes to move forward. They fulfill a functional need for critical data that allows a person to do a job as part of a sequence of jobs to be done. At a more strategic level, FCI and CCIR unlock traceability of animal health & welfare and food safety. The drivers for these initiatives come from a different place - meeting specific government objectives, industry demands, and consumer needs. 

The operational and strategic objectives do cross over at various points in the farm to fork journey, but there is not a robust connection between the data being collected for food production and the same data being needed to facilitate traceability. This is why breakpoints in the data journey are currently tolerated at best or simply not seen- different stakeholders have different agendas and can often simply get on with their own job.

* The way responsibility for collecting and communicating inspection data is largely determined by the working environment and practices in place at the FBO plant, and the lack of any apparent need for FBOs to share with the FSA any of the reports they distribute to primary producers or last known keepers, means there are no readily available statistics to track the delivery of CCIR.

### Conditions reporting and data analysis
Inspection data is being captured in IRIS, allowing for some measurement of inspection and condition recording volumes and some of this information is published on the food.gov website by the FSA. However, it has not been clear that there are any processes in place for leveraging and using this data within the FSA itself.

Detailed analysis currently depends on extracting information from IRIS. There is no integration or automated data transfer with PowerBI which is the preferred data analysis tool in Field Operations and elsewhere across the FSA. 

### Delivery time, effort and cost
Reporting on timesheets and charging data, which is captured in the Timesheeting system, processed via the Charging system, and reported on via PowerBI, is run regularly to support charging processes. 

Although charging is out of the scope of this discovery, it does provide some insight into completed inspection work and the deployment of inspection staff. It is also the only clear way of putting any kind of cost on running inspections as a service. However, time spent on administration and data handling is not chargeable to the FBO and is typically recorded as non-working time. It is difficult therefore to put a true cost on the effort of collecting and communicating FCI and CCIR data, and the time and resources spent on data management activities. 

### Business planning, surveillance and trend-spotting
The current data does not effectively support business planning, animal health and welfare surveillance initiatives, and the identification of local, regional or national trends. 

Although the number of plants is known and inspection resource demand is managed, there is no easy way to ascertain the number of inspection points across the country as a whole and to get a true picture of how efficiently inspection staff are being deployed. 

Although conditions data is being captured and largely centralised in IRIS, there is no easy way to pull, manipulate or re-use the data, or to make it readily available to audiences outside the FSA. The tendency is to create reports and provide information if it is available rather than to make it available to be pulled and in a format to suit demand and need. 

* Farm management data, animal identification, animal movement documentation, and ante- and post-mortem inspection results are being captured in unique systems and often via a variety of measures. Integrity of each piece of data cannot be assured because information can be added, changed and/or removed at multiple points in the journey.
* Approved food business operators, Statements of Resource (outlining approved activities and required resourcing), resource management, time recording, inspection demand, and throughput are all captured in disparate systems to different standards.

There is little apparent use of much of the data collected within the FSA itself, although it is a forceful asset that could enhance the FSA's profile.

## Future ways of working

Implementing key performance indicators and metrics is one of the main recommendations of this discovery.

At a service level, five guiding principles have been outlined for tracking outcomes and overcoming the challenges identified today:

* **Core information facilitates traceability** - Moving from a situation today where there are multiple breakpoints in the data journey to a position where data is a constant from farm to fork.
* **Digital where itâ€™s right; real-time where possible** - Moving from a situation today where there is a proliferation of manual data management tools & processes to a position where there is simplified data access; and managed barriers to entry.
* **Data is available, usable, auditable** - Moving from a situation today where data ownership is confused and complicated to a position where data can be pulled at the moment of need, not pushed if available.
* **Standardised, scalable solutions, and always fit for use** - Moving from a situation today where tools, data and working practices work against each other to a position where data is controlled; and methods are right-sized and proportionate.
* **Facilitate good practice to drive compliance** - Moving from a situation today where compliance is obscured by huge variance in local ways of working to a position where solutions encourage balance between facilitating and regulating.
