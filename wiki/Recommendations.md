We recommend the following priorities to sustain improved compliance:

1. [Define, apply and own standards](#define-apply-and-own-standards)
2. [Build service management capability](#build-service-management-capability)
3. [Communicate value proposition](#communicate-value-proposition)

The delivery strategy will require different approaches depending on the FSA’s sphere of control, dependency and influence. 

Key principles to bear in mind are: 

- **Fix what you own:** within the FSA’s control and mandate.

- **Collaborate proactively:** lead where the FSA has authority and interest

- **Enable others:** facilitate adoption and engagement

See [early actions](early-actions) for suggested ways to get started. 

These recommendations should be considered in light of [service success criteria](service-success-criteria). 


## Define, apply and own standards

  ### Goals 

  *“establish and uphold standards”* 

  * enable interoperability across systems and services
  * drive consistency across sites and teams 

  ### Constraints 

  * variable local environments

  * one size won’t fit all

### Constraints 

  * legislation is not prescriptive

  ### Priorities

* **Standards**
  * service delivery expectations
  * analogue and digital interfaces
  * data models / APIs
* **Patterns**
  * user experience frameworks
  * proportionate options
* **Common vocabulary**
  * consistent and accessible language
  * used predictably in user-facing and backend systems

## Build service management capability

### Goals 

*“demonstrable competence”*

* verify regulatory compliance
* identify risk points
* transparency 

### Constraints 

* asset vs service ownership
* existing data model
* internal technology infrastructure

### Priorities

- **Condition feedback reporting**
  - coverage 
  - timeliness
- **KPIs for compliance**
  - verifying food chain information
  - feeding back condition data
- **Metrics for effectiveness**
  - data journey breakpoints 
  - process vulnerabilities
  - expected vs actual behaviours
  - adoption by stakeholders

## Communicate value proposition

### Goals 

*“trusted authority”*

* improve the optics of the FSA
* enable supply chain collaboration
* drive adoption of [standards]((#define-apply-and-own-standards))

### Constraints 

* presence and visibility of FSA
* disjointed value chain
* different drivers and outcomes

### Constraints 

* common critical inputs

### Priorities

- **Develop stakeholder engagement strategy**
  - clarify and articulate FSA role
  - define FSA value proposition
  - build (on) [evidence base](#build-service-management-capability)
  - reach out openly and consistently
- **Reclaim position within traceability ecosystem**
  - reboot Partnership Working Group as a safe space
  - proactively influence LIP from an informed position
