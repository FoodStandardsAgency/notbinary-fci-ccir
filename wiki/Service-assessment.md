## What was the initial problem you were asked to look into?

**Context**

The FSA is a national Competent Authority with a remit for food safety, within this domain, the FSA has statutory obligations towards public health and animal welfare. 

The FSA undertakes official controls to ensure that animals presented for slaughter are suitable for human consumption and that any health conditions identified are fed back to farmers and producers in order to address potential disease in their stock.  

Internal audit assurance has recently identified scope for improvement in the way the agency delivers these controls, including in how supporting data - specifically Food Chain Information (FCI) and inspection results (CCIR) - are collected, communicated and used to assure food safety through improved traceability.

**Size of problem**

Farmers, producers and market suppliers report Food Chain Information for batches of animals presented for slaughter at ~280 abattoirs in England.  

Approximately 30,000 batches (as recorded in the agency’s Inspection Results Information System, IRIS) across all species are processed each month:



*   Poultry: ~12,000
*   Pig: ~8,250
*   Cattle: ~5,000
*   Sheep: ~4,500
*   Other: &lt;250

FSA staff and contractors inspect animals within batches for health conditions before and after slaughter, recording ~185,000 condition transactions monthly across all species in IRIS,. 

The system generates condition feedback reports that are sent to food business operators to cascade back to farmers and producers, as well as Broiler Reports that are verified before despatch to DEFRA.

**Discovery question/hypothesis**

The discovery remit is to examine the statutory requirements and practical constraints for receiving, processing and communicating FCI and CCIR information, as well as identifying roles and responsibilities at each stage of the data lifecycle. 

The discovery seeks to understand the challenges and opportunities to improve compliance with regulatory requirements, particularly around the accessibility and communication of data, and whether it is sufficient, reliable and useful for achieving the public health and animal welfare goals of the official controls. 

**Team observations**

**Was the initial question/hypothesis correct?**

As the Competent Authority, the FSA has responsibilities to ensure that food business operators are meeting their legal obligations for food safety within the meat supply chain. It also has to ensure that disease conditions are reported back to producers.  

Completing the feedback loop needs reliable identification data to be passed along the supply chain. The FSA is dependent on upstream suppliers - farmers and markets, as well as food business operators - to maintain an unbroken traceability chain, which is not always the case. 

The FSA has delegated its responsibility for feeding back to producers to food business operators.  It does not consistently maintain full traceability, often recording conditions against untraceable mixed batches.  It is also often dependent on tools and technologies provided by food business operators to capture condition information, and typically does not retain control of this input data. 

**Possible gaps**

User interviews and desk research indicate that plant scale, ergonomics and operations can significantly influence how consistently food chain and condition information are captured, processed and shared between FBOs and FSA operatives. 

Given lockdown conditions, the discovery team was unable to observe first-hand how data is collected and processed within different slaughterhouse environments, and therefore to gather a full range of use cases that would need to be considered. It has relied on past site tours and access to subject matter experts to supplement learnings. 

 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The emerging service pattern suggests that through a combination of delegation, consistency of enforcement and operational constraints, the FSA is hamstrung in its capacity to consistently and usefully deliver official controls. However, as Competent Authority, it does have the mechanisms to address shortcomings on its own and in partnership with industry and other interested governmental departments. The lack of prescriptive approach within the legislation - where methods and tools are not dictated by the law - are an opportunity for the FSA to define and set standards and protocols.

As part of its remit, the FSA has a broader interest in the health of the national herd. Industry stakeholders are more focused on provenance and health within their own supply chains. The scope of interests do overlap, but are not wholly aligned. There are common points of interest but slightly different drivers, which are not sufficiently well understood and appreciated across parties. This misalignment hinders collaboration towards a mutually beneficial solution. 

Conversely, the FSA’s legal responsibility for providing feedback is to the holding of provenance (the last producer). Farmers involved at earlier stages of the lifecycle are interested in potential disease issues that may have originated in their stock but do not get any such trusted report, because it is outwith the FSA’s designated remit. In such cases, the producer does not benefit and the FSA does not build its picture of the health of the national herd.

 


## Align stakeholders around the definition of the problem and recommendations

**_Demonstrate the team were able to engage the key stakeholders (internal and external, if appropriate) about the nature of the problem being explored and resulting recommendations at the end of the Discovery._**

Team observations

**Something the team did well**

Based on previous discovery experiences, the team supplemented regular Show and Tells sessions by introducing Q&A chats on Microsoft Teams to engage stakeholders around the broad scope of the discovery. Our primary research included Field Ops staff directly involved in ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection activity, as well as other internal stakeholders ranging from Legal, Application Support and Data, through Operational Assurance and Ops Transformation. 

We have also engaged broadly with industry stakeholders, seeking input from farmers, food business operators and industry groups, including the Livestock Information Service.

We have consulted broadly to understand the strategic and operational context in which FCI and CCIR are managed. The service blueprint review in Week 7 was effective in bringing the wider stakeholder community back together to validate and align around our findings. 

**Possible gaps**

More research with markets is needed - these are key waypoints in the journey where food chain information data can become lossy, and the traceability chain gets broken. Food business operators and producers use off-the-shelf software for farm and slaughterhouse operations management - engaging with software vendors and assessing the existing software provision will help inform adoption strategies. While devolved governments are following their own paths, their Competent Authorities have similar challenges - there is an opportunity to share knowledge and good practice. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The Livestock Information service has growing traction among industry stakeholders as the vehicle to enable full chain health information, in lieu of partial reporting on CCIR. While this has the risk of clashing with the FSA’s delivery of official controls there is an opportunity to proactively engage the group and align around common food safety, animal welfare and public health interests within the specific legal mandate of FCI and CCIR, and in line with the broader remit of the agency.     


## Identify all of the service users and their experience of the current service (where one exists). 

**_The team should have a good understanding of user needs, understand what users are trying to do when they engage with the current service._**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet

Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team iteratively built up the user and stakeholder picture by looking across the task and service flow of FCI and CCIR, cross-referencing responsibilities identified in legislation along with guidance in the Manual of Official Controls as well as Meat Industry Guide. 

This view was then validated through multiple primary user interviews with inspectors and vets, as well as representatives of farmers and food business operators, to determine what actually happens compared with what is supposed to occur. 

This cross-examination helped reveal how disjointed and fragmented the user experience is, and that the value of FCI (and by extension, the FSA) is not well appreciated. 

Where some audiences were harder to reach, we did receive some repeated feedback about them from others who work regularly with them. Where we encountered recurring observations between user groups we could triangulate and develop some hypothesised traits and needs in the absence of direct primary interviews.

**Possible gaps**

There is a significant range of farmers and producers, as well as food business operators, that are involved in the meat supply chain. Their experience of producing FCI and receiving CCIR is considerably variable along scale and species lines.  The discovery team engaged with a sample of these industry stakeholders through representative bodies, though availability was limited due to lockdown conditions. 

The team prioritised external research targets in the timeframe available, liaising with representative industry groups as proxies. Direct research with members of these user segments needs to be carried out to understand fully the challenges and opportunities for deliverability and adoption of any revised service. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

It is clear that a one-size-fits-all solution is unfeasible for collecting condition data, and often for receiving food chain information. The sheer range of operations and environments make it clear that, while the actors involved are broadly consistent, the practical experiences of receiving, collecting, recording and sharing that data is often significantly different - for FSA and industry parties. The variation poses challenges for the FSA. They must pull some up, meet others where they are, but also meet the advanced level of the largest operations who are already capable of delivering a good delegated data service.  

However, there are opportunities to do further primary user research to understand barriers to entry and adoption, such as appropriate language for conditions, and environments for using technology vs manual tooling.

## Identify the key service challenges and opportunities for better meeting user needs

**_For example: what are the principle elements that need solving, what could improve the user experience, efficiencies, customer satisfaction improvements, cost-benefit to change_**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet

Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The legislative scope of FCI and CCIR provides clear scope boundaries for the discovery. However, practical delivery of the official controls can’t be so easily isolated from the inspection work that is carried out at slaughterhouses. We have therefore sought to situate the FSA’s mandate in the context of its broader service portfolio. 

This contextual analysis has illustrated clearly how disjointed the service is, not only when considered in isolation, but also when viewed as part of the food traceability chain. It has made it easier to identify where service delivery value is being lost and where opportunities for collaboration across the supply chain may be ripe (as well as those opportunities that are within the exclusive purview of the FSA).   

**Possible gaps**

There is a lot of inconsistent jargon in FCI and CCIR. More work is needed to understand how terms are used and interpreted by different user segments, and to develop a common vocabulary around which the value of animal traceability and health condition data can be clearly articulated. 

Technology choices are in the hands of producers and farmers, and the FSA does not know enough about the digital maturity, capability and constraints of industry partners and their systems that are relied on to capture and communicate FCI and CCIR data. This gap will make it harder to plot an appropriate route to support digital adoption. This appetite for digital investment is likely to be diminished against a challenging financial and changing political landscape. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The key service challenge is not going to be solved by new tooling or technology. The FSA has effectively lost some ownership over the delivery of official controls, and is often either invisible or poorly regarded in the provision of FCI and CCIR data, despite holding a critical position in its collection and communication. 

Health condition information is highly sought after across the supply chain, but there is a disconnect between the role that the FSA plays in gathering trusted traceability and surveillance data. The opportunity for the FSA is to communicate the value of its official controls outcomes - particularly trend analysis from data captured - and to re-position itself as an enabler rather than - as it is currently perceived - a barrier to industry. 


## Identify key areas of focus for the next phase of work

**_For example: a part of the service that could cause particular pain or be difficult, or needs delving into in more depth to adequately understand. Indeed, whether further work is actually needed._**

**Team score**: **Met**/Partially met/Did not meet

Team observations

**Something the team did well**

The team has engaged with the two main projects (Livestock Information and Ops Transformation) that could reshape meat inspections and have a direct impact on FCI and CCIR. We recognise and emphasise a need to not just engage with them but really clarify the obligations and objectives that the FSA needs to deliver. 

Our discovery has also identified the perceived lack of value and relevance being associated with FCI in particular, and the need to get a better understanding of the bilateral relationships the FSA and inspection teams have with other agencies and bodies.

  

**Possible gaps**

No cost-benefit analysis or assessment of the FSA’s capacity or capability to implement recommendations has been carried out as part of this discovery. 

 

**Reflections/recommendations**

The FSA should endeavour to improve its capability to manage, monitor and improve service provision.  Standardising forms, language and interfaces can help improve consistency and interoperability, while using data interfaces internally to improve connections with service management tools, such as Chronos and PowerBI can start realising business intelligence value and open up service automation opportunities. This will be helpful to proactively demonstrate and communicate data value to internal and industry stakeholders.  

Business rules for batch definitions and more consistent feedback reporting should be implemented to improve data quality and compliance with legal requirements.

**Something the team did well**

Lockdown conditions have forced us into a fully remote discovery process. This has gone reasonably smoothly. At the end of the previous discovery we committed to making better use of digital whiteboard tools, and we’ve found that Miro has been particularly helpful to support remote collaboration. 

The team has honed its interview timing and techniques, including recording and analysis, iteratively diving deeper into the subject area as the discovery unfolds. 

The team used standups, sprint planning,retrospectives and show and tells to focus each sprint and share insight. Roadmapping the discovery early and ringfencing research weeks helped to scaffold the delivery plan. We’ve also injected more regular targeted workstream updates and knowledge share sessions to compensate for not being co-located. These have been efficient and effective to ensure focus and alignment across the team. 

**Possible gaps**

We were not able to get any site visits to do contextual research. While we had good representation of FSA project team members in daily standups, lockdown conditions and COVID response priorities limited the level of Product Owner involvement we enjoyed in previous discovery projects. 

**Reflections/recommendations**

Access to external stakeholders took significant effort to coordinate. Coupled with lockdown conditions, delays on this front pushed out our primary research window. The short discovery timeframe precluded the option to go through the appropriate protocols to survey external stakeholders and reach a broader audience. 

This has exacerbated time pressures for synthesis, analysis and writeup, which was already compressed with the number of public holidays during the discovery window.  The insights gained from late stakeholder interviews have been invaluable, but the run-in pressure is felt. 

While digital whiteboards have been effective, we’ve not been able to take advantage of a shared physical space. The lightbulb moments that come from standing in front of a wall with the product owner are missed.
