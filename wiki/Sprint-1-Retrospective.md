## Kudos

- Ramon Romero and Steve Crookes for solid overview and introduction to the FCI/CCIR challenge
- Gemma Beadnell & Richard Withers: 
  - for clear and insightful context setting
  - for details that help set out the context and impacts of FCI/CCIR data quality.
- Stephen Dowding for clear thinking / approach to initial internal stakeholder conversations
- Jonno Witts forgood idea for Q&A chat to extend opportunity for stakeholder engagement / feedback
- Lowri Davies
  - for quickly pulling together actionable criteria for identifying and scheduling user interview targets
  - for prepping the stakeholder session.
- Shaun Gleadle & Mark Deakin
  - pre-disco prep - feels like it's helped us get on a really sold start.
  - keeping scope focus, and flagging the rabbit holes
- Paul Turner for providing clear direction on discovery purpose and boundaries
- Mark for getting calls set up with Richard Withers and Gemma Beadnell. Good to speak to them early.
- All for working together to keep the project running smoothly given the present situation.
- Jag for good input and keeping us focus during the stakeholder session.

## Went well


- Valuable insights from Legal & Partners to set governance and operating contexts.  Good to get those in early.
- Well described target group criteria for initial user research cohort
- Discovery scheduling profile is agreed. Feels like we have set out with a good balance for prep, research and analysis, and writeup (in the circumstances).
- Combo of scope briefing, kickoff and planning sessions -> feels like we are quickly developing shared understanding of scope and workstream priorities, especially what is likely to be a major distraction.
- Clear 2 weeks for ploughing through mass of background material
- Core project scheduling admin is done - can focus on the interesting things now.
- Timestamping notes with call recordings - can focus on writing down the key points, but still have clear signpost to the elaboration.
- Stephen: Kick off conversations on Monday and Tuesday.
- Miro as virtual whiteboard for stakeholder mapping
- Superb relationship built up between the NB and FSA teams over months - couldn't do this discovery remotely in the current circumstances without that history, knowing how we work together and the trust.


## To improve

- To review later, not sure if stakeholder mapping or task mapping should come first. TBC next week!
- User v stakeholder distinction
- Keep focus on the project goal, avoid the rabbit holes and what-ifs.
- BLOODY IT kit

## Action items

- [ ] Stephen: Clarify what's appropriate in retro!
