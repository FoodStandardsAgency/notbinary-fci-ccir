## As an Official Veterinarian...
_On Arrival_
### I need...

- [ ] To be provided with complete FCI information by the FBO, so that I can conduct my ante mortem checks and uphold movement, welfare and food safety laws.
- [ ] To be able to request additional FCI or related information from the farmer/producer via the FBO, so that incomplete or questionable items are clarified or investigated. 
- [ ] To review producer FCI declarations containing drug withdrawal and animal fitness details so that I can assess (pre-AM checks) suitability for slaughter and food chain. 
- [ ] To make the abattoir aware of any animal(s) at risk of destruction due to late or missing FCI, so that they can obtain this from the producer and avoid costly disposal of the animal(s).
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Animals with missing FCI must be temporarily housed in the lairage or slaughtered and the meat detained. This creates a welfare, operational and data management overhead for the OV and FBO. 

***
_At Ante Mortem (AM) Checks_
### I need...

- [ ] To identify the correct animals as submitted in FCI or movement documents so that the correct information is recorded against carcases (for traceability).
- [ ] To identify any welfare issues arising at the primary producer or at the abattoir so that enforcement can be applied.
- [ ] To identify any animal condition or apparent disease that may affect food safety or meat quality so that unsafe meat is removed from production.
- [ ] To record antemortem inspection notes against the correct consignment of animals (producer and unload time) so that I can input the correct data later in IRIS.
- [ ] A consistent and convenient way to record my notes, observations and complete official AM record forms in the Lairage environment
- [ ] To display/communicate my antemortem decision (signature) to abattoir staff, so that animals cleared for slaughter can be processed.
***
_At Post Mortem (PM) Checks_
### I need...

- [ ] To communicate abnormal AM results to meat hygiene inspectors working on the line, so that they are prepared to process high volumes of rejections, contamination or to detain certain carcases. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` A busy abattoir with lorries arriving regularly gives the OV few opportunities to leave the lairage to attend the line to speak to MHIs or inspect detentions (avg. 2-3 times a shift). OVs must also change overalls for hygiene reasons. 
- [ ] Oversight of the work of MHI’s conducting post mortem inspections, so that I can be satisfied that official controls are being met, because I am legally responsible for all FSA inspection work at my site. 
- [ ] To inspect and sign off any detained carcases, with their appropriate identifying batch, producer or ID intact, so that any decision can be recorded later against the correct producer in IRIS.
***
_At Data Entry_
### I need...

- [ ] To protect time away from the lairage during my shift for the input of Ante Mortem and Post Mortem inspection results to IRIS, so that the FBO and FSA have a complete record of AM & PM checks in a timely fashion and I don't need to take work home.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` In a busy abattoir with lorries arriving regularly, the OV has little opportunity to leave the lairage to conduct office paperwork until the end of their shift / start of the next.
- [ ] To trust that the PM data recorded from the MHIs and collected and provided to me later by the FBO is accurate and free of mistakes, omissions or manipulation.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Condition tallies are often handled by FBOs and supplied later to the OV for input to IRIS. Data can suffer input errors, have been incorrectly transposed, or been actively tampered with. Some FSA teams use the office Daybook to record a back up reference.
- [ ] To quickly, easily or automatically enter AM & PM data into IRIS so that I can reduce OV time needed for paperwork and deliver timely FSA data to the FBO (and producer).
- [ ] To easily and efficiently enter data into IRIS where there are multiple farmers animals processed per shift so that it is feasible to report CCIR back to individual farmers. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` IRIS usability encourages the much quicker use of data entry by ‘daily batch’ entry, resulting in a loss of true traceability and making the data meaningless to farmers. 
- [ ] IRIS input fields to match the CCIR as I receive it (from MHIs or FBO), so that I don’t have to make manual calculations or conversions and save time entering data and reduce input errors. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Where FBO capture systems are relied on (eg, Hellenic) PM data is handed to MHIs in printouts. These tables / reports often vary in layout from the fields, rows and totals in IRIS and may require 'adding up'.
***
_At communicating CCIR to Farms_
### I need...

- [ ] To see collected Post Mortem results by producer, so that I can track disease or welfare issues to a particular farmer (eg, for enforcement action or outbreak traceability).
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` When conditions are recorded against a full shift / day long batch (and not individual producers) it is impossible to trace which producer owned affected animals or how many total holdings are diseased.
- [ ] Tools to manage efficient communication between myself (or any FSA duty OV) and the farmer, via or including the FBO, so that the farmer is not forced to visit me directly at work in order to seek answers to their CCIR questions.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Farmers may seek clarification on CCIR from the FSA OV. They may ask the FBO but may also mistrust them or prefer to reach the OV directly. Farmers often seek the OV out when next at the abattoir.
***
## As a Meat Hygiene Inspector...

_At Ante Mortem (AM) Checks_
### I need...
- [ ] To be made aware (by the OV) if a consignment with a suspected high rate of disease is arriving on the line, so that I can be prepared to identify and process high volumes of rejections without slowing down the line.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` A busy OV may or may not be able to communicate AM results or suspected high disease rates to the MHI ahead of that batch's arrival on the line since this data is stored offline on clipboards (AM1-4) until later that day.
- [ ] Consistent conditions lists by species and where possible consistent recording methods, so that work I do in one plant is comparable and easily repeatable in another site.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` FSA conditions lists have undergone revisions but roll outs were inconsistent and local variations persist. FBOs can also configure Hellenic input screens differently to each other. Some items may have a dedicated clicker in one plant but captured in 'other' in another. 
***
_At Post Mortem (PM) Checks_
### I need...

- [ ] To be aware where one batch of animals ends and another begins, so that I can maintain a corresponding record of condition tallies against the correct consignment or animal.
- [ ] To identify and act on the conditions I observe quickly so that I remove risky material from human consumption as a priority.
- [ ] To maintain a line of sight (or otherwise correlate) any carcase to its offal or head at any time so that I can maintain complete disease record to the right animal (cattle and pigs only).
- [ ] To a quick and simple way to record conditions, so that the act of recording does not compromise or compete with removing unsafe meat. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Fast moving lines result in lag between observation and an opportunity to record, resulting in strategies such as using mental tallies until eg, 5 or 10 conditions have been observed. 
- [ ] A hygienic way to record a rejection, while my hands are dirty, in a chainmail glove, and holding a knife or other equipment, so that the job is not hindered by the collection method. 
- [ ] To be able to easily and ergonomically reach all items I need to conduct and record inspection within arms reach so that I do not need to step away from the line or remove gloves.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Condition tally charts may be positioned across the room or require input to a shared terminals. MHIs cannot leave the inspection point easily on fast moving lines. 
- [ ] To be able to communicate an issue with a carcase to another MHI at the next inspection point so that they may be vigilant for certain issues or conditions, eg, using colour coded tags.
***
_At Data Entry_
### I need...

- [ ] To quickly, easily or automatically enter AM & PM data into IRIS so that I can reduce OV time needed for paperwork and deliver timely FSA data to the FBO (and producer).
- [ ] To easily and efficiently enter data into IRIS where there are multiple farmers animals processed per shift so that it is feasible to report CCIR back to individual farmers. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Iris usability encourages the much quicker use of data entry by ‘daily batch’ entry, resulting in a loss of true traceability and making the data meaningless to farmers. 
- [ ] IRIS input fields to match the CCIR as I receive it (from MHI’s or FBO), so that I don’t have to make manual calculations or conversions and save time entering data and reduce input errors. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Where FBO capture systems are relied on (eg, Hellenic) PM data is handed to MHI in printouts. These tables / reports often vary in layout from the fields, rows and totals in IRIS and may require 'adding up'.

## As a Food Business Operator...
_On Arrival_
### I need...

- [ ] To receive complete FCI from farmers at or before receipt of animals, so that I don't have to detain animals or carcases while I chase them for the information or ID evidence.
- [ ] To receive FCI in a consistent format, so that it is easier for me to check I have all of the legally required evidence for an animal to proceed to slaughter.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` FCI may arrive from multiple sources in different formats, from very formal (in large scale abattoir owned and managed sheds), to farmers completing documentation informally on arrival at abattoir. 
- [ ]  A convenient way share the FCI with the OV so that I am not having to maintain multiple ways of working or storing information.
- [ ] To store FCI information for a period of time, so that it is available if needed for future traceability checks (eg, product recall or welfare enforcement). 

***
_At Ante Mortem (AM) Checks_
### I need...
- [ ] The OV to clearly communicate which animals are cleared for slaughter so that abattoir staff can work efficiently to feed into the slaughter line.
- [ ] A minimum of animal/producer ID to accompany the animal along the line so that I collect data against the right animal or producer.
- [ ] The flexibility to send animals not originating from the same producer into the slaughter line on the same shift. (eg, create mixed batches) so that I meet my buyers needs and manage production.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:`Some FBOs need to procure carcases to variable retail orders, these may not exactly match farmer shipments or market purchased animal numbers. Half the animals from one batch might be slaughtered one day and the remainder the next to manage production spikes.
***
_At Post Mortem (PM) Checks_
### I need...

- [ ] To need MHIs to work quickly and efficiently when on the line, so that their duties do not hold up the kill line and production pause costs aren't incurred.
- [ ] To MHIs from different localities and shifts to identify the same conditions in the same way so that I have confidence all rejections are necessary and accurate.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` FBOs at large scale or with multiple sites have access to large data sets, these reveal inconsistencies in the ways different FSA teams are are identifying conditions (ie, across sites or shifts, perm or contract)
- [ ] A minimum of animal/producer ID to accompany the animal along the line so that I can collect data against the right animal or producer. 
- [ ] The FSA's technical maturity on site to match mine and integrate with my systems, so that I am not losing data fidelity, having to work around their operational tooling, or invest in what I can't afford. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` FBOs vary from small scale - where pen and paper is workable through to large scale industrial plants who invest in advanced product monitoring tools. However FSA methods are typically still immature. 
- [ ] To store my own record of FSA rejections data in parallel to grade, weight and other commercial data, so that I am not waiting for the FSA report and can act on trends quickly.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` FBOs may need to act quickly to pivot the kill plan or to address a welfare issue before the full consignment is slaughtered or more animals are moved from source. Waiting for FSA results is too slow. 
***
_At Data Entry_
### I need...

- [ ] The FSA to record condition and rejection data in IRIS against the correct producer within the kill shift (not batch recorded), so that I can identify which producer to apply financial deductions to. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Even where FBOs are recording PM rejections by producers in their own systems, the FSA may still be entering these as grouped 'daily batched' for speed in IRIS. 
***
_At communicating CCIR to Farms_
### I need...

- [ ] The FSA to record CCIR against individual producers (not batch), so that I can send the farmer CCIR data that relates to their animals only
- [ ] The FSA to produce a conditions report the same day so that I can send the farmer CCIR data at the same time as price, weights and grade information.
  
  > `PAIN POINT:` FBOs typically quote farmers a grade and price for their animals the same day. Sometimes paying the same day. This service is hampered by missing condition data, which may help explain price deductions or down grading as FSA reports arrive a day or two later.
***

## As a Farmer / Primary Producer...
_At the Farm_
### I need...

- [ ] To know what FCI I’m legally obliged to provide so that I can avoid financial loss of having an animal or carcase detained / destroyed if I fail to supply it.
- [ ] To understand that it’s in my interest to supply FCI so that I can receive health information about my animals (CCIR) post-slaughter.
- [ ] A simple, easy to understand form (including a plain English FCI declaration) for moving my animals to slaughter or market so that I am not confused into providing incorrect or incomplete information. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` OVs report receiving occasional FCI that contains incompatible statements, conflicting declarations or incomplete / missed ticks either due to confusion or farmers skim reading. 
- [ ] A simple and convenient way to transfer or send FCI information that does not increase the paperwork I need to complete unnecessarily so that I don't need to be in the farm office as much. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Farmers by the nature of their job are often away from a desk or computer, having relevant reference information (eg, veterinary schedules or ID tag records) to hand is a challenge, and administrative tasks are burdensome. 
- [ ] A convenient way of completing FCI while I am still at the farm / before transporting animals, so that I have any relevant information to hand and don't transport unsuitable animals.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Many farmers lack access to a printer or convenient computer, so lean on the abattoir or market to supply paper FCI declaration templates or copies which are often completed on arrival at the abattoir.
***
_At Post Mortem (PM) Checks_
### I need...
- [ ] The abattoir to maintain a traceable record of my animals at all times, so that what I get paid for (including deductions for discards) applies only to my animals.  
***
_At Data Entry_
### I need...

- [ ] The FSA to maintain a traceable record of my animals during inspections, so that health information and rejection reports I receive later (CCIR) apply only to my animals. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Where either the FBO or FSA have elected to ‘batch record’ animals by shift and not by producer, the information gathered cannot be attributed to the individual original producer. 
***
_At communicating CCIR to Farms_
### I need...

- [ ] To receive a CCIR report detailing health conditions and price itemised deductions from my animals, so that I can achieve better productivity through correcting animal health and welfare issues. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` It’s estimated a large proportion of producers (as much as 80% for sheep) never receive CCIR, whether through omission by the abattoir, failure by the FSA to share data or due to selling livestock at market.
- [ ] Usable reports in clear, recognisable terminology with benchmark indicators (eg, severity, prevalence in national herd) so that I can easily assess how serious the issue is and how best to act.
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Allegedly the usability of the standalone FSA CCIR report is poor and they are not in accessible language (eg, veterinary terms) and lack sufficient context to make them useful or easy to act on (eg, national prevalence of the condition or typical revenue loss per animal).
- [ ] To receive a CCIR report from a trusted independent authority (FSA), so that I can feel confident that the abattoir is not acting fraudulently when making deductions and that payment is fair. 
  
   > `PAIN POINT:` Though relationships vary, abattoirs are occasionally suspected by farmers and FSA staff of acting improperly by manipulating data to pass along costs to the farmer eg, machine damage incurred at plant disguised as rejected meat.
- [ ] To speak to an FSA rep about the conditions report so that I can: verify its content, understand more about rejection reasons, learn how to improve the health of my animals and avoid future losses.
