## Understand service success criteria
Success criteria are the outcomes of a process or task that enable a 'job to be done', and that meets the stakeholder's expectations and objectives.

The service blueprint includes the success criteria for the 'jobs to be done' at each stage of FCI and CCIR journey.

Service-level success criteria address the broader potential outcomes of improving the service.

## Identified service success criteria

**The FSA can support initiatives within and outside the organisation to trace:**
* Animal health and welfare where those animals form part of the food chain, such as ongoing trend surveillance programmes.
* The safety of food through the food production system, and in particular the meat industry.


**FCI and CCIR can be delivered, achieving at least the legislated minimum, and can overcome:**
* A geographically-dispersed user base of primary producers with a diverse range of operations.
* Shared responsibility for handling and communicating data with food business operators who operate at varying scale across a broad spread of business models.
* The current double-handling of information and frequent manual transfer of data.
* The tendency to push information out rather than enable user pull of data.
* The need to tread a fine line between facilitating and regulating official controls.


**The FSA can shift the barriers to more efficient and collaborative working in a complex legislative and operational space:**
* Facilitate, rather than hinder, data collection from primary producers and ensure the defined minimum information on on the disease status of the holding of provenance is collected.
* Conduct the inspections that remove unfit meat from the food chain while delivering species-specific data at the time of slaughter.
* Improve the working relationship with food business operators to manage, share, and distribute animal health and welfare information that governs the progress of meat processing in each plant and facilitates the tracing of food safety from fork back to farm.
* Efficiently manage the demands for inspection staff required at each plant and the effort required for data management.
* Improve the perceived value of FCI by reconnecting the information collected from producers with the information they receive about the health and welfare of their stock.
* Build on its centres of excellence in legal interpretation and policy definition to drive animal health & welfare and food safety in a constructive and proactive way.
* Provide and support processes and tooling that are fit for purpose and fit for use.

**The FSA can clearly articulate the purpose and value of FCI and CCIR, and:**
* Ensure it can deliver its legislative obligations while playing a constructive and collaborative role in any future Livestock Information Service.
* Leverage the opportunities presented by the Operations Transformation Programme to re-imagine ways of delivery, and engagement with a complex mix of stakeholders.
