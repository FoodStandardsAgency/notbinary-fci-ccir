The following are possible initial actions to make progress towards the strategic recommendations.  They should be considered as means towards achieving strategic outcomes, rather than isolated and complete solutions. Completing these will not deliver full compliance, but will support the compliance effort.

## Define, apply and own standards

- [ ] IRIS usability improvements (see interaction flow)
  - use consistent search patterns
  - apply approval number / establishment name pattern (as per SOR)
  - consistent text and input field sizes
  - improve UI feedback for error and warning messages 
  - visual cues for process stage (eg, ante-mortem, post-mortem)
  - visual cues for entered data
  - improve batch list loading performance
- [ ] Enforce stricter use of Mixed Batch option in IRIS 
  - add checkboxes to confirm three-part definition in MOC is met
  - this will slow down data entry, potentially increasing inspection costs for FBOs
- [ ] Provision FSA-branded and standardised human-readable feedback reports (in addition to CSV files) that do not need to be imported or re-formatted by FBOs before transfer to producers.
- [ ] Standardise and brand official model form documents
  - build up the agency's digital and analogue UI pattern library
  - consider digital signing or branding (eg, inline badges) for integrating within systems such as eAML and PigHub

### Supporting Actions

- [ ] Undertake language audit
  - standardise vocabulary across forms, data model and systems 
  - audience test with producers, markets and FBOs
- [ ] Roll out OV and MHI training on data lifecycle and value 
- [ ] Standardise and roll out on-the-line condition reporting techniques
- [ ] Talk to other government departments about lessons learned from provisioning official data submission methods for businesses with different scale of operations (eg, HMRC for Making Tax Digital). 

## Build service management capability

- [ ] Use daily reporting metrics to identify feedback compliance gaps
  - batches processed with no corresponding sent feedback reports
- [ ] Review the operational needs of the asset owner for managing compliance 
- [ ] Identify and confirm service owner
- [ ] Publish open data on controls outcomes, including non-compliances, as per [Transparency of official controls legislation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32017R0625&from=EN#d1e2420-1-1).

## Communicate value proposition

- [ ] Explore business model canvas for traceability and health condition information
- [ ] Review Terms of Reference and membership of Partnership Working Group
