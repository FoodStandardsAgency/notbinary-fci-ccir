## Definition 

Food Chain Information (FCI) and Collection & Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR) are enabling components that should make it easier to track animal health & welfare and food safety. They are a means of capturing and communicating data in areas where the FSA is the competent authority. If capturing and communicating is done effectively and efficiently, the return journey - to trace where food has come from - should be made far easier.

FCI and CCIR in this context are specifically focussed on the meat industry. For the FSA, the delivery of FCI and CCIR largely falls within its Field Operations and Operations Assurance areas.

The service depends primarily on the cooperation of primary producers of animals intended for human consumption; food business operators with approval to run slaughterhouses; and FSA-deployed vets and meat hygiene inspectors. Outside these delivery-focussed stakeholders stands a wider ring of other: FSA centres of excellence, such as FSA Compliance & Legal; other government departments and non-government agencies, such as Defra, APHA and local authorities; third party assurance schemes, such as Red Tractor; and industry bodies.


## Mission
For the purpose of this discovery, service delivery means the FSA can support initiatives to trace:
* Animal health and welfare where those animals form part of the food chain.
* The safety of food through the food production system, and in particular the meat industry.

To be successful, service delivery means the FSA must overcome:
* A geographically-dispersed user base of primary producers with a diverse range of operations.
* Shared responsibility for handling and communicating data with food business operators with a broad scale of operations. 
* The need to tread a fine line between facilitating and regulating official controls.

## Vision
To achieve these objectives and fulfill traceability regulations, the FSA plays a key role in:
* **Facilitating data collection from primary producers** on the disease status of the holding of provenance.
* **Conducting the inspections** that deliver species-specific data at the time of slaughter.
* Working closely with food business operators to **manage, share, and distribute animal health and welfare information** that governs the progress of meat processing in each plant and **facilitates the tracing of food safety** from fork back to farm.

To operate FCI and CCIR, the FSA also plays a role in:
* **Interpreting legislation** and **defining policies** that determine how animal health & welfare and food safety information is collected and managed.
* Delivering model forms that **outline the food chain information** required from primary producers.
* Determining and **coordinating the inspection staff required at each plant**, using Service Delivery Partner agreements to manage demand.
* Operating and supporting some of the **technical tooling used to store and process inspection results**.
* Facilitating the distribution of some, but not all, of the **communication of inspection results**.

## Goals
To underpin these objectives and fulfill traceability regulations, the FSA should:
* Ensure data collection from primary producers is associated with a reciprocal return of usable data on the disease status of the holding of provenance and the impact on animals supplied from that holding.
* Ensure the way it conducts the inspections that deliver species-specific data at the time of slaughter also maintain the integrity of that data.
* Build constructive working relationships with food business operators to manage, share, and distribute animal health and welfare information that governs the progress of meat processing in each plant and facilitates the tracing of food safety from fork back to farm.

To underpin the operation of FCI and CCIR, the FSA should:
* Continue to be the centre of excellence for interpreting legislation and defining policies that determine how animal health & welfare and food safety information is collected and managed.
* Work with industry and technology partners to ensure the food chain information required from primary producers is properly integrated with related processes and tools that encourage a 'right first time' approach to data capture.
* Ensure inspection resourcing accounts for the time required to manage and maintain data in proportion to the demand at each plant and the level of technology available.
* Continuously improve technical tooling used to store and process inspection results.
* Have a constructive role in ensuring producers can access and leverage inspection results.


## Service Components 
The key components that will enable FCI and CCIR as a service are:
* Understanding and differentiating the primary stakeholders, in particular: primary producers; food business operators; and the OVs and MHIs who make up inspection teams.
* The manual and digital tooling that enables the capture, handling, sharing, and distribution of food chain information and inspection results.
* The manual and digital processes that either facilitate or hinder the flow of food chain information and inspection results to the right people at the right time.
* Ensuring all key components can function within the legislative and regulatory boundaries, and understanding where and how these may create challenges to the flow of FCI and CCIR data.
