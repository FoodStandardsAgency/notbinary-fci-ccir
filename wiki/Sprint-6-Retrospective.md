## Kudos

- Jane Clark for some really informative and considered thinking on the end to end process, as well as the context for vets.
- Team - Good Show and Tell again this week. Organisation prior is really helpful and seems this is giving us better presentations.
- Gemma Beadnell for answering follow up questions coming from four weeks of research.
- Jag for yesterday's deliverable session, v. useful.
- Jag, Stephen & Jonno for continued interviewing as well as joining user interviews where they could
- Jeremy Foot (Livestock Information): open to engage.
- Mark and Shaun (again) for fielding my questions.
- Mark for following up on the market information.
- Jeremy Foot for providing more context around Livestock Information.
- Jag for the data flow map.
- Shaun for taking one for the team when it all falls apart.

## Went well


- AHDB  & BMPA interview - good strong input and sounds like they are key allies (AHDB) going forwards
- Learning quite a lot about farmers - even though it was from proxies. 3 person interviews worked well again.
- Final users all turning up / being available.
- Senior / strategic stakeholder calls. Lots of insight.
- Conversation with Jane Clark.
- Conversation with Jeremy Foot from LIP.
- Session with Ops Transformation. Good prospects. Important to make this work visible and what can be done.
- Show and Tell and Deliverables meetings.
- Better prep for Show & Tell and using it to do some analysis along the way.
- Deliverable outputs are shaping up nicely. Good compatibility without overlap.
- Video call backgrounds


## To improve

- Research weakness: Concern our knowledge of smaller FBO's (and some farmer / FBO ) is limited. Project constraint to caveat when we deliver
- Forgetting more than I can remember at this point. So much covered, and a lot is just going to get lost in the final shakedown.
- Lots of really good information this week but lots to process!
- Brain Fog / focus. So much data!
- Working out what day of the week it is.
- (Video call) backgrounds for CBI team
- Questionable treatment of stuffed animals in Marks's living room

## Action items

- [ ] Stephen: Finalise the blueprint review invitees.
- [ ] Lowri: Remember to include research caveat on Farmers / FBO's outputs assets and in service assessment
- [ ] Jonno: New video call background required.
- [ ] Stephen: Bring your monkey to work
- [ ] Mark - stuffed animals for all before service blueprint! (not assessment)
- [ ] SG: source plasterboard before 20th May
