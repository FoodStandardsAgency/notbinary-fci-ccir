### FCI & CCIR in the Service Value Chain

For the purpose of this discovery, we have concentrated on the five key activities delivered by FSA Operations that create its service value chain (as defined by Deloitte for the Operations Transformation Programme in 2019). These are activities where the FSA delivers value to stakeholders in terms of facilitating legal compliance, regulating the food industry, and enabling confidence in the food we buy and eat.

The service value chain activities are:
* Approvals
* Inspections
* Sampling & Testing
* Audit
* Enforcement

**Food Chain Information (FCI)** and **Collection & Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR)** are part of the **Inspections** activities. These Inspection activities help define the scope of this discovery.

FCI and CCIR are focussed on the meat industry. The processes and procedures covered by this discovery therefore concentrate on the journey animals take from the holding of provenance (e.g. a farm) to the abattoir, and track the various pieces of information that document that part of the journey within the end-to-end 'farm to fork' traceability.

It is worth stating that FCI and CCIR in themselves are not the key deliverables. They are enabling components that should make it easier to trace animal health & welfare and food safety. They are a means of capturing and communicating data in areas where the FSA is the competent authority. If capturing and communicating is done effectively and efficiently, the return journey - to trace where food has come from - should be made far easier.

The food production/traceability journey has been divided into stages aligned with where livestock or food product are at a given point. The scope of this discovery covers seven stages:
* On the farm
* In transit
* At the market/collection centre
* At the slaughterhouse (on arrival)
* At the slaughterhouse (ante-mortem)
* At the slaughterhouse (post-mortem)
* Reporting

These stages are described in more detail in the Timeline section.

FCI and CCIR are an instrumental part of delivering the Official Controls Regulation that govern food safety and where the FSA is the competent authority.

### FSA and other organisations
The FSA is one of a number of authorities and other bodies involved in the meat industry. It works with a number of different authorities, such as the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA), the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), and others, in collating, sharing, managing, and communicating information across the broad range of stakeholders from individual primary producers to large-scale food industry players. The Stakeholders section provides more detail on who the FSA engages with in delivering FCI and CCIR.

### Organisation structure supporting FCI and CCIR
FCI and CCIR involves stakeholders who are both creators and consumers of data at different points in time.
The principle stakeholders are:
* Primary producers
* Food Business Operators with a licence to operate slaughterhouses.
* Official Veterinarians (OV) and Meat Hygiene Inspectors (MHI)/Poultry Inspection Assistants (PIA).

These roles were the focus of primary research in this discovery.

The wider internal stakeholder group includes:
* FSA Field Operations
* FSA Operations Assurance
* FSA Digital/FSA IT
* FSA Finance
* FSA Legal

The wider external stakeholder group includes:
* ADHB
* APHA
* Defra
* Third party assurance schemes


### Scale of the service in basic numbers
* In the UK, there are approximately 70,000 keepers with at least one species.
* The FSA counts 280 approved slaughterhouses in 2020.
* Thee FSA and its Service Delivery Partner employ approximately 900 OVs and MHIs to conduct inspections and collect inspection data.
* In England & Wales, 2,432,139 inspection data records were generated for the period April 2019 to March 2020.

The Volumes & Metrics page provides more details on the number of registered farms and slaughterhouses, and the throughput of animals for human consumption.


### Previous audits and ongoing initiatives
The inspections process and delivery of FCI and CCIR has been the subject of numerous reviews and initiatives in recent years. These include:

* **An Evaluation of Food Chain Information (FCI) and Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR)** by the Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited (a subsidiary of ADHB) in February 2013.
* **Improved FCI and CCIR Report** which reported in September 2015.
* **CCIR Blockchain Pilot** with IBM in 2018-19.
* **FCI & CCIR Audit Assurance Report** which reported in January 2020.
* **Livestock Information Programme** led by ADHB with Defra which is ongoing as of May 2020.
* **FSA Operations Transformation Programme** which is ongoing as of May 2020.

The current service operates in the context where:
* data such as FCI and CCIR is under scrutiny from external stakeholders in relation to developing a far-reaching livestock information management plan for the UK.
* the policies and ways of working are under scrutiny from internal stakeholders in relation to defining the FSA of the 2020s and beyond.

## Governance overview

### Legislation

Food Chain Information (FCI) and the Collection & Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR) are legislated as part of much broader initiatives **to manage risks to human health from food** and **to safeguard and improve the health and welfare of livestock intended for human consumption**.

Animal health & welfare and food safety are legally differentiated but are intrinsically linked throughout the meat production lifecycle. Legislation has been designed to facilitate the food production process from 'farm to fork', while simultaneously enabling traceability from 'fork to farm'.

There is **no one piece of legislation or set of regulations governing traceability**. Instead, FCI and CCIR are underpinned by a raft of EU regulation, UK domestic legislation, compliance and guidance that cover the journey from primary production through to food retail. They have to be **applied in combination to deliver true traceability**.

The [Legislation Tracking Matrix](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aBmnyWnX6F6-W1fwgLWLwbgzJMiaymL3KbN78aUG8o4) has been put together to show how top level regulation filters down to good practice. This should help service and product designers to identify the criteria that need to be met by any processes or systems that are implemented to enable FCI and CCIR.




### Operational governance and guidance
Delivery of FCI and CCIR at a day-to-day implementation level is largely governed by:
* Manual for Official Controls (MOC)
* Meat Industry Guide (MIG).
* Third party assurance schemes

At the time of this discovery, the MOC and MIG are owned and controlled by the FSA. However, responsibility for the Meat Industry Guide is intended to be transferred to industry in due course.

**Manual for Official Controls**

This discovery has focussed on the following chapters of the MOC:
* [2.1 FCI and CCIR](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18GJKuA5aVlSEX9bAZkA_eJHltS6RhkeT) and associated annexes.
* [2.2 Ante-mortem inspection](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZABpKl6Iqee0FwerJbOvMyWQZuPfF9xe) and associated annexes and forms.
* [2.4 Post-mortem inspection](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1soDlVBwB8D1M80YPFBXdVme-rIycmesI) and associated annexes and forms.
* [9 Forms](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Edx13p5Y03zx9mOU8Ax7fFHUes8tWijG)


**Meat Industry Guide**

This discovery has focussed on the following chapters of the MIG:
* [11 Acceptance & Slaughter of Animals](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dLtOALQeIG8n1lt9CDTCV_K55jQnrnXC)
* [16 Food Traceability](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ubi633tU2LUtVl0dEARV8D_S4xkReQwM)

**Third party assurance schemes**

Third party assurance schemes, such as Red Tractor and the AHDB's Pig Health scheme, provide targeted, typically species-specific, initiatives to improve the health and wellbeing of animals and/or the safety of food. They play an important part in enabling primary producers to address particular issues in the food chain, and in developing consumer confidence in the food they buy.

The details of each of these schemes is beyond the scope of this discovery. However, they are noted here because **they operate in the same space as FCI and CCIR**, and typically come with their own set of criteria that may influence how a producer or food business operator carries out their processes and procedures. 

In some cases, the level of information required to achieve assurance is sufficient to supplant the need to collect standalone FCI in particular, or may drive an FBO to collect a level of inspection result detail above and beyond the level stipulated by the FSA. This can have an impact on what information is then shared and communicated with relevant stakeholders and how it is received.


### Defined governance constraints and status of service outputs
While FCI and CCIR are legislated for, and regulations are in place for specific activities and controlling specified conditions, **the methods for collecting and managing data are not prescribed**. The key constraint is clarifying who the competent authority is at a given stage in the traceability journey and understanding their policy and process for meeting the legal minimum.

Responsibility for FCI and CCIR does not simply lie with the FSA as the competent authority. The law is clear that **the Food Business Operator in particular plays a critical role in handling and communicating the data**. The **FSA therefore treads a fine line between facilitating and regulating** the activities that deliver FCI and CCIR.

In practice, this has meant that over time, **the way FCI and CCIR have been delivered has largely been determined by individual FBOs and local practices**. From a service design and analysis perspective this, combined with a lack of prescriptive good practice, all creates something of a challenge in determining the status of any outputs. That said, there is defined information that must be collected for each species and type of processing, and this provides a baseline for the outputs in whatever format it is delivered. Reporting on this baseline is, however, a particular challenge today.
