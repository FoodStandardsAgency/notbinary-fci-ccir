[Forms comparison spreadsheet available in Google Drive/Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WOF3wFAYuyyS5W9dW1jyY808VJ6bBRv8xm_LvmsV-AU/edit?usp=sharing)

The linked spreadsheet contains all the questions that are asked across all FSA forms and the widely used ARAMS (movement) form. The questions are laid out so that you can see comparable questions, regardless of whether the language used to frame it is different. This illustrates at a glance just how similar all of these forms are.

There is a form for each species as well as for specific situations such as poultry slaughtered before arrival at a plant. The main similarities are around the declarations that a farmer/producer must make about their livestock. Despite the simliarities, the design and the layout of the forms varies wildly, this adds a layer of complication for OVs when inputting data as they may have to look around the forms for particular information. Standardising the layout would reduce the cognitive load for users. None of the forms include any official FSA branding.

Example of all forms, including ARAMS used to capture FCI:
