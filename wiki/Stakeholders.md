## Service stakeholders 

The complex nature of FCI and CCIR and the way responsibility for data resides with internal and external stakeholders at different points in the journey from farm to fork means that it makes more sense to identify **primary** and **secondary stakeholders**.

The service stakeholders identified for this discovery have been sub-divided along these lines, with primary stakeholders comprising those people with the most influence over how data is created, handled, shared, and communicated; and secondary stakeholders being those with a less direct involvement in managing the data itself but who either influence the journey and/or have an objective to use the data.

As described in the [User Segments](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fci-ccir/wiki/user-segments) section, users have been defined as Creators, Handlers, and/or Consumers of FCI and CCIR data and these descriptions have been applied, where relevant, to the stakeholders listed here.

## Stakeholder mapping

For each stakeholder, the mapping describes their role and influence on the service, and their objective or interest in ensuring the service operates successfully.
