## Context 

The FSA is a national Competent Authority with a remit for food safety. Within this domain, the FSA has statutory obligations towards public health and animal welfare. 

[FCI](glossary#fci) and [CCIR](glossary#ccir) are mechanisms for the FSA to meet those obligations through 

* surveillance and traceability, for disease prevention and control
* in partnership with industry stakeholders

The service requirement is to provide useful and timely information for producers to identify and address potential food-related public health issues within their stock, prior to presenting animals for slaughter. 

In its capacity as Competent Authority and through its slaughterhouse inspections remit, the FSA is uniquely positioned and mandated to achieve this by 

- gathering health intelligence of the national herd
- providing insight for producers to address condition issues
- offering reliable, accurate and timely research data and analysis from a trusted authority

A challenge for the FSA is to execute its official controls mandate with due consideration to the operational constraints of producers and food business operators. 

## Goal

The discovery aims to review the way data is captured and recorded for 

- Food Chain Information (FCI), and 
- Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR)

This will help identify key areas of delivery to improve compliance with regulatory requirements, particularly for

- accessibility and communication of 
- sufficient, reliable and useful data

The discovery will aim to describe the minimum viable product needed by the FSA (internal) and the partnership opportunities (external) to improve compliance. 

## Scope 

Over the course of the discovery period we will

- examine the **FCI and CCIR data lifecycle**, across all species, including
  - statutory requirements and practical constraints
  - how data is received, processed, stored, shared or reused
- identify clear **roles and responsibilities** at each stage, including
  - producers
  - food business operators 
  - other government departments

To avoid duplication and focus on the food production data lifecycle within the time available, the discovery will take into account without repeating **adjacencies**, such as previous work (eg, Blockchain) and ongoing projects (eg, Livestock Information Programme) carried out by the FSA and partners.
